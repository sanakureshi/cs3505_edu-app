# Choosing a Copyright License

I chose the "Mozilla Public License 2" for my open source project because it lets people use, modify, and distribute my software without many restrictions. The license also includes a patent clause that protects users from potential patent problems. It works well with other open source licenses, and it's a well-known and respected license that avoids legal issues. In summary, MPL 2 is a great choice for open source projects. It's also easy for developers to work together when they use MPL 2, which is a bonus. Overall, MPL 2 is a well-known and respected license that provides legal certainty and is a good option for open source projects.
